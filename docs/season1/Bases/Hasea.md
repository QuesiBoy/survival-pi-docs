## Lore and Tales

Hesea stands today in the same place where an old kingdom once existed, a kingdom ruled by fear and blood.
One day this kingdom decided to pick a fight against a powerfull empire, The Modorist Empire. This war proved to be fatal for this old kingdom, has they were destroyed, but because the Emperor of The Modorist Empire hated wars and death he let the poor people alive and alone leaving them to create a new city ruled by the people and they called it:The City of Hesea

## Build Process

The build process of this base was all over the place, it was never planned to be so big, the original idea was just the starter base area and some more buildings but the creator got addicted to minecraft and playing on a server so the small village needed to grow.
So the first expansion was to take place, a lot of birch forest was destroyed and a lot of new buildings were built and with each building learning new tecniques, the church that survived the old war was built and the old castle too, QuesiBoy's first ever castle. But with the end of the first expansion feeling a bit burned out he decided to change projects and go build a viking village.
After the viking village being finished, around 2 months later, The city of Hesea was again the main project but there wasnt much space for new buildings so the secound expansion started, a lot was build, a lot of city houses, a mine, a mine storage room, a building for a bamboo farm, a small hotel (that never had an interior), and a small lake. But after this there wasnt enough space again.
The third and biggest expansion happened, the rest of the birch forest was destroyed and some of the biggest builds were built, a big library with a clock tower, the green build of the waggins workshop, and the cloths factury. A lot of city houses were also built, some with interiors some without, but never the less all the building were in place, only the decoration was needed and that was all done on the last month of playing.
