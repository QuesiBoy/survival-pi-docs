## Lore and Tales

###The origin of Hesea
 The city that was never meant to exist. This city wasnt planned it just happened, it was never meant to exist because the creator of the base never wanted to play enough time on the server to make such a big base, but it happened and its good that it happened.

### The Story of Hesea

 Hesea was built from the ashes of an old kingdom that once stood on the same place, a kingdom of blood, iron and bad wine. One day the king of that kingdom decided to declare war to the wrong empire, The Modorist empire, they were destroyed but because the people of the Modorist Empire didnt want more people to suffer they let the people free and this people created Hesea, a place of piece without a ruler.
  

## Build Process
- Like every build it started with a small house, QuesiBoy's starter base, then like every player he needed a storage room and a tavern for some reason, so they were built, after a bit the first area of the city was done and QuesiBoy wanted to build more so...
- He built more, he destroyed another birch forest and there one by one the first expansion of Hesea happened, still far from the size it was going to have one day but big enough to look like a city. A church was built and also the old castle that survived the old war.
- But even after that he wasnt satisfied, after a small brake to build a viking village he decided that another expansion was to be built, so another part of a birch forest was destroyed and another part of the city was built but every time Quesi finished an area he wanted more.
- So more he built, the biggest expansion until now, the rest of the birch forest was destroyed and a lot of terraforming was done and this time he built bigger, a big library was built, the big green building that is a waggin repair shop was built and a lot more buildings. And of course the exterior decoration was all done finnaly.
- Of course with over 60 buildings on the city there is 60 different interiors to be done, not all of them were built but around Half of all of the buildings have interior.
